        Outside of the web development world, I usually spend my time immersed
        in synthetic sounds and digital arts. My entire life has been immersed
        in the digital world, even before I realized my potential as a software
        developer.

        I was just a kid born in the city. Every evening, I put a wired
        headphones on, plug them into my Sony Walkman, wander the streets, and
        immersing myself in trance music. It was during these moments that I
        allowed my senses to absorb the vibrant energy of the city and people.
        Occasionally, I would capture candid moments and cityscapes through my
        lens, only to return home and edit them for sheer enjoyment.

          As I grew up, I transitioned from relying solely on buses and
          skytrains to riding a bicycle. I was captivated by the sensation of
          the wind breezing through me as I swiftly pedaled forward. It provided
          a unique experience, faster than walking yet slower than driving, just
          enough for me to immerse in my surroundings.

          Later on, I decided to get a cycling computer, which sparked my
          curiosity and led me down a path of intense research in the field of
          sports science. I became determined to enhance my physical
          capabilities and surpass the limits of my own analyzed biometric data.

          A couple of years later, I found myself being recruited into numerous
          cycling communities and participating in racing tours across the
          country. Additionally, I had the privilege of working as a staff
          member for prominent cycling brands like Endomondo, Strava, and Rapha.

          After gaining experience from traveling to various places, my passion
          for photography grew stronger. I desired to enhance the fidelity of my
          captures, which led me to purchase my first mirrorless camera.

          The file data produced by a real camera censors extended my
          capabilities to manipulate and process images even further. Once
          again, I dove deep into the research within the field of image
          processing.

          A couple more years forwarded, during which I dedicated myself to
          honing both my capturing and post-processing skills. Through
          diligently practice, my work began to gain recognition, ultimately
          leading me to become a freelance photographer.
