        Outside of the web development world, I usually spend my time immersed
        in synthetic sounds and digital arts. My entire life has been immersed
        in the digital world, even before I realized my potential as a software
        developer.

        I was just a kid born in the city. Every evening, I put a wired
        headphones on, plug them into my Sony Walkman, wander the streets, and
        immersing myself in trance music. It was during these moments that I
        allowed my senses to absorb the vibrant energy of the city and people.
        Occasionally, I would capture candid moments and cityscapes through my
        lens, only to return home and edit them for sheer enjoyment.

          As I grew up, I transitioned from relying solely on buses and
          skytrains to riding a bicycle. I was captivated by the sensation of
          the wind breezing through me as I swiftly pedaled forward. It provided
          a unique experience, faster than walking yet slower than driving, just
          enough for me to immerse in my surroundings.

          Later on, I decided to get a cycling computer, which sparked my
          curiosity and led me down a path of intense research in the field of
          sports science. I became determined to enhance my physical
          capabilities and surpass the limits of my own analyzed biometric data.

          A couple of years later, I found myself being recruited into numerous

          country. Additionally, I had the privilege of working as a staff
          member for prominent cycling brands like Endomondo, Strava, and Rapha.

          After gaining experience from traveling to various places, my passion
          for photography grew stronger. I desired to enhance the fidelity of my
          captures, which led me to purchase my first mirrorless camera.

          The file data produced by a real camera censors extended my
          capabilities to manipulate and process images even further. Once

        I initially started my journey in Web3 and later transitioned into Web2
        development. It all began during the bull run market when I actively
        participated in numerous Web3 communities. At first, I focused on
        trading exclusively on centralized exchanges. As time went on, I
        ventured into off-ramp trading on decentralized exchanges and became
        deeply involved in various communities.

        Utilizing my aesthetic skills, such as color grading, photography,
        typography, and graphic design, I began assisting multiple startup
        teams. I enthusiastically supported numerous start-up teams, driven by
        the passion to see the impact of my works in the digital world. As a
        result, this led to my first contract work as a graphic designer for a
        Web3 project team.

        After a few months, armed with practical experience gained from
        supporting different teams in various capacities, I established my own
        team. As a product designer and manager, I juggled a multitude of
        responsibilities such as team recruitment, design work, trading,
        community moderation, and more.

        However, despite my involvement in diverse roles, there was one aspect I
        had yet to fully grasp - web development. Previously, my team and I
        would rely on hiring developers to set up our websites using our assets.
        That's when I started diving into web development research. In no time,
        I became proficient enough to utilize templates and update content
        independently. Subsequently, I began accumulating reusable components,
        both for my own side-projects and for teams affiliated with mine. The
        more I learned, the deeper I immersed myself in web development
        abstraction. Eventually, I delegated my previous responsibilities to
        other team members, allowing me to focus primarily on web development!

        Once the crypto bull run came to an end, I made a conscious decision to
        dedicate myself to full-time web development learning from the comfort
        of bedroom. I immersed myself in a vast array of online resources,
        ranging from tutorial videos on platforms like YouTube, online courses,
        insightful blogs, and even the ever-reliable Stack Overflow. It's safe
        to say that I explored a wide range of sources, absorbing knowledge from
        each of them.

    <div class="py-8">

        During this period, I began exploring into frameworks such as React.JS,
        while also familiarizing myself with the terminal and command line
        interface. My focus primarily revolved around my studying routines, as I
        dedicated countless hours to acquiring new skills and expanding my
        understanding of web development.

    <div class="py-8">
      <text class="text-lg">
        I felt the need for a more structured and comprehensive learning
        experience. Therefore, I made the decision to enroll in the Full Stack
        Web Development program at the University of Illinois - Chicago. This
        intensive 12-week program provided me with a full-time immersive
        environment to enhance my web development skills.

        During the program, I confronted the aspects and tools that I had
        previously avoided, realizing that they were indispensable to my growth.
        Furthermore, the areas where I already possessed strength underwent
        further refinement at a fundamental level. The bootcamp provided
        invaluable guidance on how modern web applications should be designed
        and developed.

        While the journey was challenging, I approached it with unwavering
        determination and a clear vision of success. Looking back at the end of
        the program, I was astounded by my own capability to absorb a vast
        amount of knowledge and swiftly apply it in a condensed and intense
        timeframe.
