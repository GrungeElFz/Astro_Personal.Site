        Outside of the web development world, I usually spend my time immersed
        in synthetic sounds and digital arts. My entire life has been immersed
        in the digital world, even before I realized my potential as a software
        developer.

        I was just a kid born in the city. Every evening, I put a wired
        headphones on, plug them into my Sony Walkman, wander the streets, and
        immersing myself in trance music. It was during these moments that I
        allowed my senses to absorb the vibrant energy of the city and people.
        Occasionally, I would capture candid moments and cityscapes through my
        lens, only to return home and edit them for sheer enjoyment.
