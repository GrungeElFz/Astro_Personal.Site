Managing directories efficiently is crucial for productivity when working in a command-line environment. In this blog post, we will explore a handy ZSH command that simplifies the process of creating directories and navigating between them. By combining a few simple commands, we can streamline directory operations and save valuable time.

<div class="mockup-code mb-5">
  <pre data-prefix=">"><code>mkdir DIR_NAME</code></pre>
  <pre data-prefix=">"><code>ls</code></pre>
  <pre data-prefix="" class="grid text-info">
    <code>DIR_1 DIR_2 DIR_3 DIR_NAME</code>
  </pre>
  <pre data-prefix=">"><code>cd DIR_NAME</code></pre> 
</div>

<div class="mockup-code mb-5">
  <pre data-prefix=">"><code>mkdir DIR_NAME && cd $_</code></pre> 
</div>

> - Simplified command line

## The Command

Let's break down each component of the command `mkdir DIR_NAME && cd $_`

1. `mkdir DIR_NAME`: Creates a directory named `DIR_NAME` in the current location.

2. `&&`: A logical operator ensuring the second command runs only if the first command succeeds.

3. `cd $_`: Changes the current directory to the one specified by `$_`, which represents the last argument of the previous command.

## Simplifying Directory Creation

The command offers several benefits for creating directories in a single step:

- **Efficiency**: By combining the directory creation and navigation steps, you eliminate the need for separate commands, saving time and effort.

- **Convenience**: You can create a directory and immediately switch to it in one swift action, avoiding the extra step of manually navigating to the directory.

## Streamlining Directory Navigation

The command not only simplifies directory creation but also improves navigation between newly created directories:

- **Automatic Switching**: After creating a directory, the command automatically switches the current directory to the newly created one, eliminating the need for a separate navigation command.

- **Efficient Workflow**: By seamlessly transitioning to the newly created directory, you can continue working without interruption, enhancing your productivity.

## Customizing the Command

The command is flexible and can be customized to suit your preferences and workflows:

- **Additional ZSH Features**: You can incorporate additional features of ZSH or command options to enhance the command further. Explore ZSH documentation to discover more possibilities.

- **Personalization**: Customize the command based on your preferred naming conventions, directory structures, or additional actions you want to perform after creating a directory.

## Conclusion

With the `mkdir DIR_NAME && cd $_` command, we can simplify directory creation and navigation, boosting productivity in command-line environments. By combining these simple steps into a single command, we reduce manual effort and streamline our workflow. Whether for creating multiple directories or quickly accessing newly created ones, this command proves to be a valuable tool in our development toolkit.
