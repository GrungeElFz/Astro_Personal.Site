> _Do you remember that feeling — holding your first smartphone, the world of endless possibilities opening up in your hands? What if we take a step further? Imagine a world where the digital merges seamlessly with the real, no longer trapped behind a screen. A world where information, entertainment, and connection surround us, not just in our hands._

> _Are we on the verge of a technological shift as significant as the introduction of the smartphone?_

Meta believes so, and this technological revolution is on the
<a href="https://horizon.meta.com" target="_blank">horizon</a> _(pun intended)_.
They're betting big on augmented reality (AR) glasses to lead the charge for the next paradigm shift.

## The impossible is possible

On September 25, 2024, Meta shattered expectations by introducing the first fully functional prototype of its AR glasses - Meta Orion. The consensus? These aren't just another step forward; they're the most advanced AR glasses ever created.

This cutting-edge implementation is a testament to Meta's relentless pursuit of innovation in both augmented reality and virtual reality, as creating such a device was once considered nearly impossible with this current technological stage.

## Seeing is Believing

AR is about effortlessly merging the digital with the physical, creating an experience that's as informative as it is amazing. Picture yourself walking through a museum, with historical facts and interactive displays appearing right beside the exhibits, exploring a new city with directions and points of interest guiding you effortlessly through the streets, or just simply seeing step-by-step repair instructions overlaid on a broken appliance.

But bringing this vision to life hasn't been easy. The perennial challenge with such devices has been their displays. These often suffer from issues like bulkiness, excessive heat generation, poor resolution, or a limited field of view.

Orion's display represents a significant leap forward in AR technology. Meta has custom-engineered a unique type of display system with Micro LED projectors embedded in the frame, beaming lights into nano-etched waveguides within the lenses. These lenses are made with silicon carbide, which one of the properties is an ultrahigh index of refraction, enabling the projected light to fill a greater portion of your vision.

It's not quite magic, but it's close. The result is a holographic-like effect, where digital information appears to float seamlessly in your real-world surroundings.

## The Force is Strong

Orion's control scheme combines eye tracking, hand tracking, voice commands, and a groundbreaking neural wristband.

The nueral band, reminiscent of a screenless Fitbit, interpret electrical signals from the muscles in your forearm via electromyography (EMG), translating them into commands and return a haptic feedback, all in milliseconds.

The wristband currently recognizes a range of gestures:

- **Thumb and Index Finger Pinch**: Selects items or confirms actions, acting as the equivalent of a mouse click.
- **Thumb and Middle Finger Pinch**: Navigates to the home screen or app launcher, providing a quick way to access core functions.
- **Thumb Rub on Closed Fist**: Scrolls content up or down, allowing for easy navigation of menus and lists

![](https://i.insider.com/66f42cc3d17aa3c7b2b5e91b?width=800&format=jpeg&auto=webp)

It's an incredibly intuitive system - your eyes guide, your fingers act. This natural mapping of actions, coupled with near-instantaneous feedback from the neural interface, gives the connections between the physical and digital worlds.

It's not just about convenience, it's about feeling like you're directly manipulating the digital elements within your own reality, creating a truly immersive AR experience.

    class="w-full scale-125"
  />
</div>

This is just the first step towards a future where the boundaries between the physical and digital worlds dissolve. Meta's ambition is to create an AR experience so seamless, so intuitive, that it feels like a natural extension of our own reality. In this mixed reality, information, entertainment, and connection will flow effortlessly around us.

## Assistant on Mixed Reality

With Meta AI seamlessly integrated, Orion becomes more than just AR glasses – it's a smart assistant that understands your surroundings and enhances them with helpful digital overlays.

Need a recipe idea? Ask Orion, and watch as suggestions and instructions based of what you already have in the kitchen appear right on your kitchen counter, turning your everyday cooking into a culinary adventure.

<div class="relative overflow-hidden">

    class="w-full scale-125"  
  />
</div>

Engaged in a conversation with someone speaking a different language? Watch as their words transform into subtitles, floating effortlessly beside them. No more awkward pauses or misunderstandings, just the joy of genuine human connection.

The possibilities extend far beyond these examples. Imagine a future where students dissect virtual frogs with interactive, labeled organs right on their desks. Architects could stroll through their designs at scale, making real-time adjustments before construction even begins.

What other ways can you imagine an AI assistant enhancing your everyday life in mixed reality? The possibilities are truly endless.

## Not Just Another Prototype

Meta's unveiling of Orion at <a href="https://www.meta.com/connect" target="_blank">Connect 2024</a> was more than just a glimpse into the future; it marked a significant milestone in the company's journey toward AR glasses.

Starting today, Meta is granting access to the Orion prototype to its employees and select external partners. This crucial ongoing development and feedback loop will allow Meta to gather real-world feedback and refine the technology further, focusing on three key areas:

- **Display Quality**: Increasing the resolution and enhancing the overall AR experience.
- **Form Factor**: Optimizing the design for a greater comfort and everyday wearability
- **Affordability**: Scaling production to achieve a consumer-friendly price point.
