Are we on the cusp of a technological revolution that will make smartphones obsolete?

Meta is convinced that a technological revolution is on the

and they're betting big on augmented reality (AR) glasses to lead the charge.

## The impossible is possible

On September 25, 2024, Meta officially introduced the first fully functional prototype of its AR glasses - Meta Orion. The consensus is that these are the most advanced AR glasses ever created.

> " It was so challenging that we thought we had less than a 10% chance of pulling it off successfully. Until now. "

> -- Andrew Bosworth, Meta's Chief Technology Officer

## Seeing is Believing

At its core, Orion is simply a miniaturized computer designed to be worn on your face. The perennial challenge with such devices has been their displays, which often suffer from being bulky, generating excessive heat, offering poor resolution, or providing a limited field of view.

Orion's display represents a significant leap forward in AR technology. Meta has custom-engineered a unique type of display system with Micro LED projectors embedded in the frame, beaming lights into nano-etched waveguides within the lenses. These lenses are made with silicon carbide, which one of the properties is an ultrahigh index of refraction, enabling the projected light to fill a greater portion of your vision.

Essentially, it's a hologram.

## The Force is Strong

Orion's control scheme combines eye tracking, hand tracking, voice commands, and a groundbreaking neural wristband.

The nueral band, reminiscent of a screenless Fitbit, interpret electrical signals from the muscles in your forearm via electromyography (EMG), translating them into commands and return a haptic feedback, all in milliseconds.

The wristband currently recognizes a range of gestures:

- **Thumb and Index Finger Pinch**: Selects items or confirms actions, acting as the equivalent of a mouse click.
- **Thumb and Middle Finger Pinch**: Navigates to the home screen or app launcher, providing a quick way to access core functions.
- **Thumb Rub on Closed Fist**: Scrolls content up or down, allowing for easy navigation of menus and lists

Eye movements act as the cursor, and pinching your fingers serves as a click.

## Assistant on Mixed Reality

With Meta AI seamlessly integrated into Orion, you'll have a smart assistant that understands your environment and layers helpful visualizations on top of your physical world.

Imagine walking into your kitchen and asking for a creative recipe based on the ingredients you already have on hand. Orion will then overlay suggestions and instructions right onto your countertops, transforming cooking into an interactive experience.

Imagine conversing with someone in another language, and seeing their words instantly translated into subtitles layered directly onto their surroundings, allow you to focus on their expressions, their gestures, and the shared human experience.

## Not Just Another Prototype

Meta took a significant stride towards its augmented reality ambitions at Connect 2024, unveiling Orion, its most advanced AR glasses prototype to date. While still in development, Orion represents a tangible step towards the company's vision of consumer-ready AR glasses in the near future.

Starting today, Meta is granting access to the Orion prototype to its employees and select external partners. This crucial ongoing development and feedback loop will help the development team refine the product further, focusing on three key areas:

- **Display Quality**: Increasing the resolution and enhancing the overall AR experience.
- **Form Factor**: Optimizing the design for a greater comfort and everyday wearability
- **Affordability**: Scaling production to achieve a consumer-friendly price point.

> " Orion isn’t just a window into the future – it’s a look at the very real possibilities within reach today. "
