## What is Tesla's Optimus Bot?

Tesla's Optimus Bot made its debut at the AI Day event in 2021 as a humanoid robot designed to undertake hazardous, repetitive, and mundane tasks.

Leveraging Tesla's expertise in self-driving technology, the Optimus Bot is equipped to sense its surroundings, map its environment, and autonomously navigate through it.

## Custom-built Actuators

During Tesla's Q2 2023 Investor Conference Call, Elon Musk revealed crucial details about Optimus Bot's actuators:

> We found that there are actually no suppliers that can produce the actuators. There are no off-the-shelf actuators that work well for a humanoid robot, at any price.
>
> We've actually had to design our own actuators that integrate the motor, the power electronics, the controllers, the sensors. Every one of them is custom design.

The team responsible for crafting these custom-built actuators is the same team behind the revolutionary powertrain of the Tesla Model S Plaid.

Tesla's engineers' commitment to creating their own actuators indicates their dedication to fulfilling the vision of a humanoid robot with unmatched capabilities. The ability to design components according to precise specifications empowers them to optimize the robot's performance.

Moreover, Tesla's expertise in large-scale manufacturing positions them to streamline the production of custom-built actuators to meet mass-volume demands.

> We are designing these actuators for volume production, So, they're not just lighter, tighter, and more capable than any other actuators that we're aware of that exist in the world. These are also actually manufacturable, so we'll be able to make them in volume.

The potential of custom actuators extends far beyond just optimizing the Optimus Bot's performance. These groundbreaking developments hold the promise of transforming multiple industries, particularly in the realm of assistive technologies.

Imagine coupling [Neuralink](https://neuralink.com/)'s implant technology with robotic limbs â€” this could revolutionize the lives of millions of disabled individuals worldwide. Custom actuators could create a seamless connection between the user's brain signals and the prosthetic limb, enabling enhanced mobility and functionality. This significant advancement would represent a giant leap forward in overcoming our biological limitations.

By pushing the boundaries of what's possible with custom-built actuators, Tesla's Optimus Bot is not just a remarkable humanoid robot but a catalyst for the future of robotics, with potential applications that could positively impact humanity in ways we had only dreamed of.
